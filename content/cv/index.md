## Summary

As a technical communicator with over 8 years of experience in software product documentation, I create user goal-focused content for technical audiences. In addition to creating new feature documentation for test engineers, software developers, and system administrators, I have conducted content improvement projects to increase usability and maintenance of existing documentation. My primary authoring tool has been DITA XML, both in a CCMS and a docs-as-code environment. Based in Austin, Texas, I have a history of productive collaboration with on-site and remote teams.
